#Donation Station

This is a project using Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, Devise authentication, and the Stripe API. It's a responsive web app for donating funds to various non-profit organizations. Here's what it does:

* Adds new non-profits to the list
* Creates a non-profit as a Stripe recipient
* Tokenizes credit and debit card information
* Allows a logged in user to make a one time only donation
* Allows a logged in user to create a subscription to a specified non-profit
* Allows an admin to transfer funds to a non-profit
